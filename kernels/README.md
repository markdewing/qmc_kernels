List of kernels

- [Vector add](vector_add) -  A very simple kernel to show basic implementations.   Not necessarily important to QMC.
- [Integration](integration) - Multidimensional quadrature for a simple wavefunction.  Computationally intense.
- [Spline](spline) - 3D splines.  Very important for evaluating single particle orbitals.
- [Generalized Eigensolver](generalized_eigensolve) - Part of the "linear method" for optimizating variational parameters.  Becomes important for scaling up in the number of parameters (higher quality wavefunction)
